# Array Input and Display Program in C++

This is a simple C++ program designed to help beginners understand how to work with arrays. The program allows users to input elements into an array and then displays the elements along with their indices. It covers basic C++ concepts like loops, arrays, and standard input/output operations.

## Features

- **Array Declaration**: Initializes a fixed-size array in C++.
- **User Input**: Prompts users to enter values to populate the array.
- **Display Output**: Outputs the values of the array in order with their respective indices.

## How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as `g++`. You can download it as part of the [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

### Steps to Run the Program

1. **Clone the Repository** (or download the files directly):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2. **Compile the Code**:
    Use a C++ compiler to compile the code. For example, with `g++`:
    ```bash
    g++ array.cpp -o array_program
    ```

3. **Run the Executable**:
    ```bash
    ./array_program
    ```

4. **Follow On-Screen Prompts**: 
   - Enter `6` integers when prompted to populate the array.
   - The program will then display the elements of the array.
