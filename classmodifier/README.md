# Area of Circle Program

## Overview
This project is a simple C++ program that calculates the area of a circle given its radius. It uses a class called `areaofcircle` which contains methods to compute the area.

## Code Structure

- **Class `areaofcircle`:** 
  - Contains a constructor to initialize the radius of the circle.
  - Has a method `areaofcircle_fun()` to calculate the area based on the radius.
  
- **Main Function:**
  - Creates an object of the `areaofcircle` class.
  -  Outputs the radius and the computed area.
 
  ## Output
  -Radius of circle: 5
  -Area of circle: 78.5
