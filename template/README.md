# Template Bitwise Operations in C++

This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates the use of templates to perform bitwise operations on arrays.

## File
- `template.cpp`: Program to perform bitwise operations using templates.

## Concept
This project demonstrates the use of templates in C++ programming to perform bitwise AND operations on two arrays. Templates allow functions to operate with generic types, making the program more flexible and reusable.

## Build
To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system, such as `g++`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `template.cpp` file.
4. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```sh
   g++ template.cpp -o template

   ```sh
   
   ./template
