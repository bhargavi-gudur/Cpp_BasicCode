# Bitwise Operations in C++

## Overview
This project demonstrates various bitwise operations in C++. The file `bitwise.cpp` includes a function that performs AND, OR, NAND, NOT, and XOR operations on integer values and prints the results to the console.

## File Descriptions

- `bitwise.cpp`: Contains the implementation of bitwise operations.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the program:

```bash
- g++ bitwise.cpp -o bitwise
- ./bitwise
