# Odd Even Array

This project provides a C++ program to separate odd and even numbers from a predefined array and display them. It demonstrates the use of `std::array`, object-oriented programming principles, and conditional logic to classify numbers as either odd or even.

## File Structure
- **odd_even_array.cpp**: Main program file, containing the `OddEven` class and logic to separate and print odd and even numbers from an array.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
- Basic understanding of C++ syntax and standard libraries.

### Compilation

To compile the code, use the following command in the terminal:
```bash
g++ odd_even_array.cpp -o odd_even_array
./odd_even_array
