# Maps in C++

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the usage of maps in C++ by processing a vector of integers. The program calculates the square of each integer and stores it in a map, then iterates through the map to display the results.

#### Description:
`maps.cpp` is a simple C++ program that showcases the use of maps for storing and processing numerical data. The program consists of a main function and a helper function called `maps_ordered_fun`.

#### Functions:

1. **main**: 
    - Initializes a vector of integers.
    - Calls the `maps_ordered_fun` function.
    - Prints the result.

2. **maps_ordered_fun**: 
    - Takes a vector of integers as input.
    - Calculates the square of each number.
    - Stores each number and its square in a map.
    - Prints the contents of the map.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
2. Compile the program using the following command:
    ```sh
    g++ maps.cpp -o maps
    ```
3. Run the executable:
    ```sh
    ./maps
    ```
