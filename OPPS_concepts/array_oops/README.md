# clsobjArray

This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates fundamental concepts and techniques in C++ programming, focusing on arrays and classes.

## Concept
This project demonstrates the usage of arrays and classes in C++ programming. Arrays are fundamental data structures that store elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations, while classes provide a way to bundle data and methods together. This example provides a basic understanding of array declaration, initialization, iteration, and the use of classes to encapsulate functionality.

## File
- `clsobjArray.cpp`: Program that demonstrates the usage of arrays and classes in C++.

## Build
To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. For instance, you can use `g++`, which is widely available on various platforms.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `clsobjArray.cpp` file.
4. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```sh
   g++ clsobjArray.cpp -o clsobjArray
