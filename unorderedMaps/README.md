# Code Practice Repository

## Overview
This repository contains simple C++ programs to help beginners understand and practice key programming concepts. Each program is structured to demonstrate a specific topic, such as algorithms, data structures, or language features.

## Repository Structure
1. **unorderedMaps.cpp**: A program to find and print the first unique number in a vector using an `unordered_map`.

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the program folder.
- Compile the code using a C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ unorderedMaps.cpp -o unorderedMaps`.
- Run the executable to see the output.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding how to use `unordered_map` for counting elements.
- Learning to find unique elements in a collection.
- Practicing loop control and conditional logic in C++.

## Contributions
Contributions to improve the repository are welcome! Fork the repository, make your changes, and create a pull request.

### Steps to Run the Program

1. **Clone the Repository** (or download the files directly):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2. **Compile the Code**:
    Use a C++ compiler to compile the code. For example, with `g++`:
    ```bash
    g++ unorderedMaps.cpp -o unorderedMaps
    ```

3. **Run the Executable**:
    ```bash
    ./unorderedMaps
    ```
