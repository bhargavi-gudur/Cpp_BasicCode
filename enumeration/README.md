# Enumeration WeekDays Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of enumerations in C++ to represent and manipulate the days of the week. It includes functions that process and print out the days in both integer and string formats.

## Features

- **Enumeration for Weekdays**: Utilizes C++ enums to define days of the week.
- **Day Processing Functions**: Contains functions to print days in integer and string formats.
- **Educational Use**: Serves as an example for learning how to use enums and basic I/O in C++.

## Components

- **Enum Declaration**: Defines the days of the week using enums.
- **Array Initialization**: Initializes an array with enum values for each day.
- **Processing Functions**: 
  - One function to process and print the days as integers.
  - Another function to convert and print the days as strings.

## How to Use

1. **Compile** the source code with a C++ compiler.
2. **Run** the compiled executable to see the output of day processing functions.

## Purpose

- **Learning Resource**: Intended for educational purposes to understand enums and basic C++ syntax.
- **Demonstration**: Showcases how to work with enums and arrays in C++.
