# Switch Case Arithmetic Operations in C++

This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates the use of switch-case statements to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program allows the user to choose an operation to perform on two integers.

## File
- `switch_case.cpp`: Program to perform arithmetic operations using switch-case statements.

## Concept
This project demonstrates the use of switch-case statements in C++ programming to perform different arithmetic operations based on user input. It covers basic operations like addition, subtraction, modulus, division, multiplication, and XOR.

## Build
To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system, such as `g++`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `switch_case.cpp` file.
4. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```sh
   g++ switch_case.cpp -o switch_case 

  ```sh
  ./switch_case
