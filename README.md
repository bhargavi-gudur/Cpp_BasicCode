# Code Practice Repository

A collection of simple C++ programs designed to help understand and practice fundamental programming concepts. Each folder in the repository contains code that demonstrates a specific topic or functionality.

## Repository Structure

### 1. `addition`
This folder contains a simple program to perform basic addition of numbers. It is intended to help beginners understand how to perform arithmetic operations in C++ and how to take user input.

### 2. `bubblesort`
The `bubblesort` folder contains an implementation of the bubble sort algorithm using C++'s inbuilt `swap` function. The bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It provides an example of using templates in C++ and covers how to implement basic sorting logic.

### 3. `classmodifier`
This folder includes code examples demonstrating the use of class modifiers in C++. It likely explores concepts such as:
- Access specifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`).
- How classes are used to encapsulate data and functions.
- Object-oriented programming fundamentals in C++.

### 4. `helloworld`
The `helloworld` folder contains the most basic C++ program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. It is a standard starting point for learning any programming language and introduces you to:
- Basic syntax of C++.
- Writing and compiling a simple program.
- Using the `iostream` library for output.
  
### 5. bubblesort
The bubblesort folder contains an implementation of the bubble sort algorithm using C++'s inbuilt swap function. The bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It provides an example of using templates in C++ and covers how to implement basic sorting logic.

### 6. passArrToFun
This folder includes examples of how to pass arrays to functions in C++, showcasing different techniques and use cases.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**: To download the code to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd code-practice
    ```

2. **Navigate to a Folder**: Each folder contains a standalone C++ program or set of programs. Navigate to the desired folder based on the topic you want to explore:
    ```bash
    cd <folder-name>
    ```

3. **Compile and Run the Code**: Use a C++ compiler to compile the code in the folder. For example, using `g++`:
    ```bash
    g++ <filename.cpp> -o <output-file>
    ./<output-file>
    ```
    Replace `<filename.cpp>` with the C++ source file and `<output-file>` with the desired name of the compiled executable.

## Learning Objectives

- **Addition Program**: Learn how to handle basic arithmetic operations and user input in C++.
- **Bubble Sort**: Understand how the bubble sort algorithm works and how to use templates and the `swap` function in C++.
- **Class Modifiers**: Explore object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, and access specifiers.
- **Hello World**: Get familiar with the basic structure of a C++ program, syntax, and console output.
