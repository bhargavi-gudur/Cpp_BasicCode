# Code Practice Repository

A collection of simple C++ programs designed to help understand and practice fundamental programming concepts. Each folder in the repository contains code that demonstrates a specific topic or functionality.

## Repository Structure
- [Cpp_BasicCode](https://github.com/bhargavi-gudur/Cpp_BasicCode.git)

### 1. `addition`

This folder contains a simple program to perform basic addition of numbers. It is intended to help beginners understand how to perform arithmetic operations in C++ and how to take user input.

### 2. `bubblesort`

The `bubblesort` folder contains an implementation of the bubble sort algorithm using C++'s inbuilt `swap` function. The bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It provides an example of using templates in C++ and covers how to implement basic sorting logic.

### 3. `classmodifier`

This folder includes code examples demonstrating the use of class modifiers in C++. It likely explores concepts such as:

- Access specifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`)
- How classes are used to encapsulate data and functions
- Object-oriented programming fundamentals in C++

### 4. `helloworld`

The `helloworld` folder contains the most basic C++ program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. It is a standard starting point for learning any programming language and introduces you to:

- Basic syntax of C++
- Writing and compiling a simple program
- Using the `iostream` library for output

### 5. `passArrToFun`

This folder includes examples of how to pass arrays to functions in C++, showcasing different techniques and use cases.

### 6. `copyconstructor`
The `copyconstructor` class includes a parameterized constructor, a copy constructor, a destructor, and a method to display the value of its member variable.

### 7. `prime_num`
The file `prime_num.cpp` includes a function that checks if a given integer is prime and prints the result to the console.

### 8. `bitwise`

The file `bitwise.cpp` includes a function that performs AND, OR, NAND, NOT, and XOR operations on integer values and prints the results to the console.

### 9. `min_max_arr`
The `minmax_arr.cpp` file contains a C++ program that finds the minimum and maximum values in an array.

### 10. `array`

The program allows users to input elements into an array and then displays the elements along with their indices. It covers basic C++ concepts like loops, arrays, and standard input/output operations.

### 11. `structure`

This project demonstrates the use of structures in C++. The `areaofcircle` structure is used to store and display the radius and area of a circle.

### 12. `VowelOrConsonant`

Sample program to determine whether a character is a vowel or consonant.

### 13. `Array_STL`

Programs demonstrating arrays using the STL container.

### 14. `Cls_obj_array`

Class and object programs for array manipulation.

### 15. `Cls_obj_vector`

Programs demonstrating the use of classes and objects with vectors.

### 16. `DynamicMemAlloction`
Programs for dynamic memory allocation.

### 17. `Enumeration`
Programs using enumerations.

### 18. `Map`
Programs involving the use of map containers.

### 19. `Odd_even`
Programs to separate odd and even numbers using arrays.

### 20. `Odd_even_array`
STL array to separate odd and even numbers.

### 21. `Odd_even_vector`
Programs to separate odd and even numbers using vectors.

### 22. `PairSTL`
Basic programs using the pair container in STL.

### 23. `Pointer`
Programs using pointers and call by reference.

### 24. `Pointer_types`

Programs using void pointers.

### 25. `Ptr_dynamicMemAlloc`
Programs using pointers for dynamic memory allocation.

### 26. `SwapNum_obj`
Programs to swap numbers using objects and classes.

### 27. `SwitchEnum`
Programs using enumeration and switch cases for geometric shapes.

### 28. `Switch_case`
Programs using switch case for arithmetic operations.

### 29. `Template`
Programs using templates and the AND operator.

### 30. `UnorderedMaps`
Programs using vectors and unordered maps.

### 31. `Unordered_map`
Programs using unordered maps to manage and display cumulative sums.

### 32. `Vector`

Programs using vectors.
- Vector Basics: A vector is a dynamic array that can grow and shrink in size.
- Adding Elements: Use `push_back()` to add elements.
- Accessing Elements: Elements can be accessed using an index or an iterator.
- Size: Use `size()` to get the number of elements.
- Removing Elements: Use `pop_back()` to remove the last element.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**: To download the code to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd code-practice
    ```

2. **Navigate to a Folder**: Each folder contains a standalone C++ program or set of programs. Navigate to the desired folder based on the topic you want to explore:

    ```bash
    cd <folder-name>
    ```

3. **Compile and Run the Code**: Use a C++ compiler to compile the code in the folder. For example, using `g++`:
    ```bash
    g++ <filename.cpp> -o <output-file>
    ./<output-file>
    ```
    Replace `<filename.cpp>` with the C++ source file and `<output-file>` with the desired name of the compiled executable.

## Learning Objectives

- **Addition Program**: Learn how to handle basic arithmetic operations and user input in C++.
- **Bubble Sort**: Understand how the bubble sort algorithm works and how to use templates and the `swap` function in C++.
- **Class Modifiers**: Explore object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, and access specifiers.
- **Hello World**: Get familiar with the basic structure of a C++ program, syntax, and console output.
