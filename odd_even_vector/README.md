This project demonstrates how to classify numbers as odd or even using vectors in C++.

## Project Structure

- `odd_even_vector.cpp`: Contains the main logic for adding numbers to a vector, and checking if they are odd or even.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler (or any other C++ compiler)
- CMake (optional, for building the project)

### Building the Project

To build the project using GCC:

```sh
g++ -o odd_even_vector odd_even_vector.cpp
./odd_even_vector
